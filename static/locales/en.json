The group's common goal is to attract young volunteers to participate in various activities, from environmental clean-ups and educational workshops to supporting local charities and organizing community events. The group's mission is to empower youth to become dynamic, responsible \"knights\", addressing challenges with creativity and dedication. Chicken Knights achieve their goal of creating a better and more compassionate society for everyone through teamwork and a shared vision.",
            "content2": "Many good people do good deeds and spread positivity to the community. Many even volunteer to fight against pandemics, hunger, or social charity without needing to equip themselves with armor or ride to a specific place. They deserve the title of knight. All it takes is the quality, spirit, and high ethics to help and do good deeds. That is what is considered noble and courageous in a person. And that is the true definition of a knight."
